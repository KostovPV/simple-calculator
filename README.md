# React + Vite

## Simple Calculator

This project implements a basic calculator to practice and learn the proper functioning and organization of React state.

## Features

- Basic mathematical operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division
- Percentage calculations
- Special operations: square root, reciprocal, square

## Installation

1. **Install Dependencies:**

   Run the following command to install all necessary dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Running the Project:**

   Use the following command to start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   This will start the Vite development server and you can view the application at `http://localhost:5173` (or whichever port Vite specifies).

## Usage

1. **Basic Operations:**
   - Click on the number buttons to input numbers.
   - Select an operator to specify the desired operation (e.g., `+`, `-`, `x`, `/`).
   - Press `=` to calculate the result.
   - Use `C` to clear the input or `Del` to delete the last digit.

2. **Special Operations:**
   - **Reciprocal (`1/x`):** Calculates the reciprocal of the current input.
   - **Square (`x²`):** Computes the square of the current input.
   - **Square Root (`√`):** Calculates the square root of the current input.

## Development

To contribute to or modify the project:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Start the development server with `npm run dev`.
4. Make your changes and test them.
